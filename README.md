**Caveats and Limitations Facebook's Terms of Service:** Directly scraping Facebook content is against their Terms of Service and may lead to your IP being blocked or your account being suspended. Use this tool responsibly and ethically.

  

**UI Changes:** Facebook frequently updates its user interface and HTML structure. This extension relies on specific CSS selectors to find group information. If Facebook changes its layout, the extension might stop working until the selectors are updated.

  

**Rate Limiting:** This extension does not implement explicit rate-limiting. Rapid or excessive use might trigger Facebook's anti-scraping mechanisms.

  

**Dynamic Loading:** Facebook loads content dynamically. The extension includes a delay to allow content to load, but in some cases, not all groups might be captured if they load asynchronously after the initial delay.

  

**Authentication:** The extension assumes you are already logged into Facebook. It does not handle authentication itself.

  

**Limited Search Scope:** The extension performs a basic search for groups. It does not offer advanced filtering options available on Facebook.
